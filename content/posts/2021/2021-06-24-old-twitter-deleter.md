My new personal project automatically clean up old tweets.

I wrote some technical detail why this is a thing in the [git README](https://github.com/logan-han/twitter-deleter)

Largely motivated by all tools available doing this either asks for payment like [this](https://tweetdeleter.com/pricing) and [this](https://www.tweeteraser.com/) or need some tech knowledge to setup & run the script. 

My app also need to know how to compress & decompress files but should be easier than setting up oAuth token and install some python or javascript dependanies from a terminal.
