My less than 6m old Sony WH-1000XM4 suddenly started making wind like static noise from the right side only.

After a few tests, I've confirmed it's a persistent issue hence sent it back for RMA process.

The RMA engineer claimed they can't find any issue & sent back the item as it is yet, the issue is still there.

Then I found [this](https://ap.community.sony.com/s/question/0D54O00006EtSgwSAF/wh1000xmx-headphones-active-noise-canceling-crippled-by-noise-caused-by-focus-on-voice-feature-fix-in-next-revision-please?language=en_US) interesting article in Sony forum which linked to [a reddit post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sony/comments/ibleuj/wh1000xm3_wh1000xm4_staticcrackling_noise_solution/)

The proposed solution, putting a silica gel, been working fine so far.

It's astonishing to see this poor quality product coming from Sony, the inventor of Walkman and pioneer of AV industry. ðŸ¤”
