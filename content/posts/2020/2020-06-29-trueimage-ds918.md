TrueImage can't be installed on DS918+

To bypass it, download the docker package from below URL and get a hex editor.

[https://archive.synology.com/download/Package/spk/AcronisTrueImage/1.0.0000/AcronisTrueImage-dockerx64-1.0.0000.spk](https://archive.synology.com/download/Package/spk/AcronisTrueImage/1.0.0000/AcronisTrueImage-dockerx64-1.0.0000.spk)

Open the file and edit archtype dockerx64 to x86\_64 then ensure backfill the reduced characters into places like description as it does have size check.

Manually install the package file from the package manager. It will prompt for crc check error, but you can ignore and continue.
