Quoted $300+ from dealer shop which I know a serious rip-off price for mere carbon filter.

Searched eBay, local stock comes with some $100 price tag, still too steep.

Found a [German seller](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Aktivkohlefilter-Mercedes-A-Klasse-W176-B-Klasse-W246-W242-Innenraumfilter/191687096452), selling compatible filter for approx. $27 for the item and $15 shipping - even made in Germany!

The confusing part was finding b250 cabin filter replacement in YouTube resulting the previous model, W245(2005-2011). Any 2012~ model need to search for W246 instead, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKx8U57URlM).

5-10 minutes work, don't even need a screw driver. Boom, saved $250+.
