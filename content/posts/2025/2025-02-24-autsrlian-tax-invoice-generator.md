As I embarked on my first contractor gig, I was asked to provide my own tax invoice. Having dealt with countless invoices over the years, I assumed it would be a simple task. To my surprise, most tax invoice generators out there require payment—some even take a percentage of the transaction, like Stripe. Others, for something as basic as a Word or Excel template, ask for your email just to send you spam.

So, I decided to create my own tool. It’s straightforward and meets all legal requirements, including GST calculation. It doesn’t store any of your information and allows you to pre-fill key details by bookmarking the site.

After my previous personal project, the Twitter Deleter, came to an unfortunate end due to Elon Musk charging hefty fees for X API 2.0, I figured it was a good time to launch something new!
