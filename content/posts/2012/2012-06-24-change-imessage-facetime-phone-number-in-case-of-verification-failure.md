Happened me after carrier change. Keep picking up SIM build-in number rather than my old number ported in later.  
  
1\. Turn off both facetime & imessage.  
2\. reset network settings from general settings.  
3\. make sure settings->phone->my number has your number.  
4\. Turn on facebook & imessage.
