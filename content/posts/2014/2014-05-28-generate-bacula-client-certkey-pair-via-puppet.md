```
exec {'generate client key file':
command => '/usr/bin/openssl genrsa -out /bacula/bacula-client.key 2048;chmod 600 /bacula/bacula-client.key',
creates => '/bacula/bacula-client.key',
require => Package['bacula-fd'],
}

exec {'generate client cert file':
command => '/usr/bin/openssl req -new -key /bacula/bacula-client.key -x509 -subj "/C=AU/ST=somewhere/L=somewhere/O=something/CN=something" -out /bacula/bacula-client.cert',
creates => '/bacula/bacula-client.cert',
require => [ Package['bacula-fd'], Exec['generate client key file'], ],
}

exec {'combine client key and cert files':
notify => Service["bacula-fd"],
command => '/bin/cat /bacula/bacula-client.key /bacula/bacula-client.cert > /bacula/bacula-client.pem;chmod 600 /bacula/bacula-client.pem',
creates => '/bacula/bacula-client.pem',
require => [ Package['bacula-fd'], Exec['generate client key file'], Exec['generate client cert file'], ],
}

Would be nicer if I can send them to backup location but doesn't really matter as there's master key.
