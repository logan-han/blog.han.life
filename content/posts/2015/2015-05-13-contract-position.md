pros: Market standard is 30% extra compare to similar perm position, pro-rata basis. Can claim expense for pretty much all the things, if there's any.

cons: 9.5% superannuation 3% agency fee (bit cheaper if you manage your tax bits and indemnity insurance by yourself) 8.3% annual leave (20 working days = 4 weeks) 4.16% personal leave (10 working days = 2 weeks) in total: 24.96%

IMO, 5% income boost + some additional tax deduction doesn't really make much sense.

Not sure it's worth leave perm job.

dn;tl: It's not simple 30% salary bump trade off for job security
